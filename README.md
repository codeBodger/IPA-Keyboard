# IPA Keyboard

- This program, or rather pair of programs, allows the user to use a tablet or other touch screen device as an IPA Keyboard.  
- To get it to work, you may need to install some dependencies, or you may not.  
- What is currently labeled as the "host" and "client" are, in reality, the oposite of what they actually are.  
  The "host" is the side with the touch screen, where you want to type.  The "client" is the side that you want the characters to appear on.
